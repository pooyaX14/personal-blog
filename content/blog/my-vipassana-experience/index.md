It was the beginning of January 2018, my second time. A 10-day rigorous retreat, during which you'd live your life as an ascetic and do nothing but mindfulness meditation.

I went to this meditation retreat as a _dhamma_ server. As servers, it was our duty to serve meditators — by making sure the kitchen is clean and food is prepared before lunchtime, and helping them by providing any necessary things that they might have forgotten to bring. Thus, making sure they get the best out of the course without any difficulties and issues.

Along with me was one more server. We had to share our responsibilities equally, taking turns to do things. After all, being a server is a challenge — and at the same time, a very fulfilling experience. You might ask — _what makes it challenging_?

Well, there’s the waking up at 4 A.M part, for the next 10 days. And that’s just the beginning, heh. Once awake, we servers would need to go around the dormitory, ringing bells. The students would wake up hearing the bells and be ready by 4:30 am, to begin their first meditation hour of the day.

Now I’m not an early morning person, so waking up at 4 a.m required lots of motivation to get out of bed. To my surprise, I didn’t find it very hard to wake up this early even when I am not used to.

Most of the students were pretty serious about it and didn’t create any chaos. They woke up in time and were there soon in the meditation hall. Hardly any rules were broken. The usual ones were a handful that you had to adhere to — observe complete silence, make no sort of gestures, avoid eye contact, no touching, no lies, no use of any electronic devices, pen or paper.

Basically, you will be prohibited from doing anything other than meditation, sleep, food, bathing. I know it might feel very intimidating at first since we’re so used to checking our social media accounts.

> You can survive 10 days without using your phone. Trust me.

Although I gotta tell you — these 10 days are gonna be your longest 10 days ever. HAHA. You’ll feel like as if you are stuck here forever. Time runs at a sluggish pace! One feels like running away from there to return to home, back to the chaos which we all know so well and love.

It’s a strange thing, really. In the chaos, the mind longs for peace and solitude. But it has long forgotten how solitude and silence can feel like. To an untrained mind, it can feel almost overwhelming, too much to bear. And before long, we want to return to the world of wildness.

> “Madness, as you know, is like gravity. All it takes is a little push.” — The Dark Knight

This is not for everyone. Only the strongest of minds will be able to bear the excruciating pain that they go through in this duration.

No, no one is going to torture you there. It’s your mind that will make you go crazy when you’re meditating. Thoughts will engulf you, overpower you, and will take you down to the rabbit hole. And if you are not mindful, you might stay there very long, until your mind comes back to the present moment and reminds you to focus on breathing.

Though there are different types of meditations catering to different needs of people, I have only practised the Vipassana technique. This method was rediscovered by Gautama Buddha almost 2500 years ago. The goal of this meditation is _purification of the mind_.

After my second 10 day retreat, I went on to meditate every day for over a year. So I know a thing or two about it.

# [What is Vipassana meditation](https://www.dhamma.org/en-US/about/vipassana)

I got introduced to Vipassana for the first time in 2015 which is when I attended my first 10 day course. This form teaches you to see things as they are. No contemplating, no manipulating, no illusion, no delusion. Accepting reality as it is, not as you would like it to be. As you work with the truth moment by moment, one is eventually bound to experience the [**nirvanic**](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/nirvanic) peace within.

## The technique

This meditation works with physical sensations in the body. One will observe the bodily sensations starting from the top of their head, scanning part by part every inch of the body. As you scan them, you check for sensations if any are present at that moment. Most important of all, remain equanimous when you feel any sensations — itching, pain, throbbing, pulsating, free flow etc.

Whenever you work with sensations, you are working with the deepest level of your mind — the **_subconscious mind_**. Our gross mind is not subtle enough to feel the sensations which are present throughout our body every moment. Here, we work with sensations, thus, working with the subconscious mind. Lastly, don’t react to it with the understanding that this is also impermanent.

This meditation purifies the mind, helping it get rid of any mind related problems or psychosomatic diseases to go away. But one should not practice it for the sake of curing their ailments. Vipassana is more than that.

> Key: Be aware of your sensations, remain equanimous.

# The vast virtues of Vipassana —

There are benefits of Vipassana if practised properly - and plenty of them have been researched in science as well. Though it takes time to tame our untrained mind, the results are inevitable —

####**Heightened sensitivity and awareness**

You will start observing small things that might never have caught your attention like rising up and down your tummy belly when you breathe. You also become aware of positive and negative emotions that manifest themselves from time to time due to some reason or the other.

####**Equanimity**

 You start observing your sensations with equanimity - maintaining composure and remaining calm. Yes, that makes all the difference, because soon it starts manifesting itself into other areas of your life. Why?

Because you're training yourself to remain objective. It will become your habit to observe any negativity as soon as it arises, and recognize it for what it is. That way, you will have more control over your actions, rather than blindly reacting to it.
 
It might be a little difficult to observe your sensations when you’re engulfed by your emotions/pain/anger/hatred/ego. Definitely, but not impossible. It just needs more practice, just like any other activity.

####**Changing thought patterns and perspectives**

If you’ve been practising it consistently and as the technique want you to practice it without any dogma. One will definitely start seeing changes in their thought patterns.

It will give you a fresh new perspective on your relationships with your parents, colleagues, partner and with everyone around you. Your shallow views on relationships and friendships change, as you're able to look at things objectively.

####**Selflessness and gratitude**

You don’t now expect favours from someone whom you helped or want to help. You become more compassionate and kind to oneself and to every living being — visible or invisible. You start wishing good for others — and even more so if they are your enemy. You will see you start developing more compassion for people who have hurt you, betrayed you.

####**Self-love**

Self-love is different from "selfish" love. It is the kind of love that compels you to accept yourself with all the flaws that have been eating you alive. You understand that self-hatred doesn’t do any good to yourself. Instead, you focus your energy on things which actually matters.

Some of the other benefits are even physiological. There are studies that indicate that regular practitioners have increased pain tolerance, lower blood pressure levels, and enjoy better health than non-meditators, when accounted for lifestyle and other factors.

The scriptures also talk about benefits that go beyond the "physical" reality, and into the metaphysical. On how you can break the cycle of karmic debt. On matters related to existence, and how you can expand your own consciousness. After all, Buddha attained "enlightenment" by this very technique! Who really knows what that is?

These things might not even make any sense to you at this point - and sound too good to be true. And that's okay - it’s not at all necessary to believe in things that don’t make any sense to you at this point in time. In Gautama Buddha’s very beautiful words —

> “Do not believe in anything simply because you have heard it. Do not believe in anything simply because it is spoken and rumoured by many. Do not believe in anything simply because it is found written in your religious books. Do not believe in anything merely on the authority of your teachers and elders. Do not believe in traditions because they have been handed down for many generations.
> 
> But after observation and analysis, when you find that anything agrees with reason and is conducive to the good and **benefit** of one and all, then accept it and live up to’’

 The key points here being **observation** and **analysis**. The theory will only take you so far, and some things you'll have no other choice but to see for yourself. Until then, it's important to have trust in the process. Doubt can be powerful, but it can also become a hindrance in your exploration.

# Concluding Thoughts (Or dare I say Equanimous?) 😜

As I said earlier, this is going to be difficult. But aren’t all activities that lead to personal growth usually are? This is a spiritual path and not some cool activity that you do to show off to your friends.

Just like you can’t build bigger muscles without going through a painful ordeal in the gym, in the same way, you can’t build a better mind without going through this trial of mental fortitude and will.

Go forth, and know thyself, my friend!
